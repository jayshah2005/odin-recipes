        Gujarati word for tempering in English and tadka in Hindi) is a very popular 
        comfort food among people of Gujarat and is often known as Gujarati Khichdi.

            <li>4-5 Garlic Cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 Teaspoon Mustard Seeds</li>
            <li>4-5 Curry Leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon Red Chilli Powder</li>

            <li>1 Tablespoon Oil</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Rinse rice and moong dal in water. Drain the water and transfer them 
                to a pressure cooker (3-5 liter capacity). Add 3½ cups water, 
                turmeric powder and salt. Mix well and taste the water for salt and 
                add more if required.
            </li>
            <li>
                Close the lid and pressure cook for 4-whistles, cook on high flame 
                until first whistle is completed and then reduce the flame to medium. 
                Cook over medium flame for remaining three whistles. Turn off the 
                flame. Do not open the lid until pressure releases naturally (opening 
                the lid immediately will result in uncooked khichdi). Open the lid 
                after about 20 minutes and stir and mix the cooked khichdi with a 
                spoon or spatula.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 1-tablespoon oil in a small tempering pan. When oil is medium 
                hot, add mustard seeds. When they start to pop, add cumin seeds, 
                chopped garlic cloves and curry leaves. When garlic starts to turn 
                light brown, turn off the flame (It will start to turn light brown 
                within 30-40 seconds). Add red chilli powder and cumin-coriander 
                powder and mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour tempering (tadka/ vaghar) over cooked khichdi and mix with a 
                spoon. Vaghareli khichdi is now ready to serve. Enjoy it with plain 
                curd and papad.
