    <h1>Panner Tikka Wrap</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="text">
            It is nothing but tongue tickling spicy paneer tikka wrapped in chapati or 
            paratha. It is not only a different way of enjoying paneer tikkas with 
            routine paratha or chapati but also a healthy, stomach filling food that 
            can simply liven up your taste buds. Making paneer kathi rolls at home 
            involves three steps, 1. make spicy tikka for filling, 2. make chapati for 
            the wrap and 3. combine both into a stuffed wrap.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol class="text">
                <li>
                    Take thick curd, corn flour, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli 
                    powder, garam masala powder, kasuri methi, coriander powder, chaat 
                    masala powder and salt in a large bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix all ingredients to prepare a marinade.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add paneer cubes, capsicum, tomato and onion. Mix gently to coat 
                    them with marinade. Cover them with a plastic wrap or a lid and 
                    place in the refrigerator for around 25-30 minutes.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a non-stick pan. Saut√© marinated capsicum, 
                    paneer, onion and tomato for 5 to 7 minutes over medium flame.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn off the flame, add lemon juice and mix well. Paneer tikka, 
                    which will be used as stuffing, is ready. Divide it into 4-5 
                    portions and proceed to make chapati which will be used as a wrap 
                    for the rolls.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cut onion into thin slices and sprinkle a little bit of chaat 
                    masala powder over it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take one chapati and spread 1-2 teaspoons green mint chutney 
                    evenly over it. If chapati is not hot, re-heat on tava for few 
                    seconds before making the roll.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put one portion of filling in the center and spread it lengthwise.
                    Add some sliced onion. Wrap the filling tightly with chapati and 
                    make a roll. Wrap the roll halfway with aluminum foil and serve 
                    with mint chutney and vegetable salad.
