        <h3>For Dough</h3>
        <ol class="text"> 
            <li>
                Combine 1½ cups wheat flour, 2 teaspoons oil and salt in a large bowl. 
                Add enough water (incrementally in small quantities) and knead smooth 
                and soft dough (like roti dough). Grease surface of the dough with 
                1-teaspoon oil. Cover it and set it aside for 15-20 minutes to settle 
                at room temperature.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For Preparing Stuffing</h3>
        <ol class="text">
            <li>
                Combine grated paneer and grated potato in a medium bowl. 
                Make sure that there are no potato lumps, as they will tear the 
                dough while rolling. Add chopped green chillies, grated ginger, 
                chopped coriander leaves, coriander-cumin powder, red chilli powder, 
                garam masala powder, chopped mint leaves, lemon juice and salt.

                Mix all ingredients properly. Filling (stuffing) is ready.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Directions for Making Paneer Paratha</h3>
        <ol class="text">
            <li>
                Divide the dough into 6 equal parts and give them a round shape like 
                ball. Take one dough ball, press it between your palms or on rolling 
                board to make a flat pattie. Take 1/2 cup dry wheat flour in a deep 
                plate. Coat each pattie with dry flour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place dough pattie on rolling board/roti making board (chakla) and 
                roll it out using a rolling pin into a thick circle of approx. 4-5 inch
                 diameter. Put approx. 2 tablespoons stuffing in the center, wrap it 
                 with sides of rolled circle, seal the edges and again give it a round 
                 shape like ball.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press stuffed ball on rolling board and coat it with dry flour. Roll 
                it out gently into 1/4 inch thick circular paratha of 6-7 inch 
                diameter (like roti or chapati)
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a tava/griddle over medium flame. When tava is medium hot, place 
                rolled paratha over it.
            </li>
    
            <li>
                When tiny bubbles start to rise on the surface, flip it upside down 
                and reduce flame to low. Spread 1/2 teaspoon oil over the surface 
                with the help of a spatula or a spoon and cook for approx. 30 seconds.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Flip again and spread 1/2 teaspoon oil over  another side. 
                Gently press the paratha with spatula and cook for 30-40 seconds 
                over medium flame. Repeat flip and cook process until golden brown 
                spots appear on both sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer it to a plate and spread some butter over it. Follow the same 
                process for remaining dough balls. Serve Paner Partaha with pickle and 
                onion raita.
            </li>
